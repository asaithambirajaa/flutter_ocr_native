## 0.0.6

* Lowered SDK constraint to `>=3.2.4 <4.0.0` (Flutter 3.19.0+) for broader compatibility
* Fixed `Color.toARGB32()` not available on older Dart versions — replaced with version-safe `_colorToArgb()` helper using `.a/.r/.g/.b` float API
* Zero deprecation warnings on all Dart 3.x versions (3.2.4 through 3.11+)

## 0.0.5

* Updated README with complete usage documentation for all features
* Added examples for Basic OCR, Validation & Aadhaar Masking, Document Viewer, Download with Watermark, Custom Validator, and Runtime Toggle

## 0.0.4

* Fixed watermark not appearing in downloaded images
* Moved watermark rendering from `dart:ui` Canvas to native platform (Android Canvas / iOS CoreGraphics) for reliable text rendering
* Added `burnWatermark` native method channel — watermark is now burned into images on the native side
* Auto-scaled watermark font size to 3% of image width (minimum 36px) — always readable regardless of image resolution
* Bold watermark text with 1.5x line height for better readability
* Added `downloadBytes()` method to `OcrDocumentSaver` for saving raw bytes directly
* Added `path_provider` as plugin dependency — platform-specific download paths handled internally
* Removed `path_provider` dependency from example app — package handles it
* Simplified `OcrDocumentViewer` save — uses native `burnWatermark` instead of unreliable `RepaintBoundary` capture

## 0.0.3

* Added `OcrWatermark` model — configurable watermark with key-value lines (Lead ID, Lat, Long, Agent, Date, etc.), customizable text color, background color, font size, and padding
* Added `OcrDocumentViewer` widget — full-screen document viewer with pinch-to-zoom (0.5x–5x), watermark overlay below image, configurable save button, and `OcrDocumentViewer.show()` for one-liner navigation
* Added `OcrDocumentSaver` utility — saves masked/original image to file with watermark burned into the image using Canvas, supports save from file path or raw bytes
* Viewer save captures the watermark in the exported image via `RepaintBoundary`
* Updated example app with View and Download buttons using the new package utilities
